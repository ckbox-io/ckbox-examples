# CKEditor integration

:warning: This is just a code sample. It is NOT ready for production use!

CKBox feature is enabled by default in all the [predefined CKEditor builds](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html).

To enable CKBox in your CKEditor instance, add all the required configuration options to the object under the `ckbox` property. In the simplest scenario, CKBox requires only the `tokenUrl` option.

## Quick start

Install packages:

```
npm install
```

Serve sample:

```
npm start
```

Sample will be available at http://localhost:4137.

## Documentation

Please refer to official [CKBox documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckbox/latest/guides/configuration/ckeditor-integration.html) for more info.
